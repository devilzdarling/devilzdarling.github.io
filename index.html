<p>As the world is getting flatter by virtue of the information highway created by the internet, the need of the hour is a systematic dissemination of education. Information to education is a major jump, and we need to take it. Reliable and simplified domain area knowledge is hard to acquire unless you are ready to pay for a LLB/MBA degree at a top University – and sometimes not even then. If you add to that the opportunity cost of leaving your current job, relocation, travelling to college etc. – online education starts to look very appealing.</p>

<p>This is why distance learning is becoming very relevant in India. Much of the workforce need and want skill upgradation – but how can it be delivered to them efficiently? Indian students are hungry for better quality education – how can high quality education be provided to them at an affordable cost? The solution has to be found in online education.</p>
